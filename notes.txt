  * Set of error-correction codes that can be used to detect and correct the errors.
  * Widely used in computer networks.
  
Reduntant Bits:
  + Extra binary bits that are generated and added to the information-carrying bits of data transfer.
  + Formula to calculate reduntant bits.
                       ------------------------------
                      |         2^r > m +r+1         |
                       ------------------------------
                       
Parity Bits:
  + A bit appended to a data of binary bits to ensure that the total number of 1â€™s in the data are even or odd.
  + Used for error detection.
  ----> Even Parity Bit:
        + count 1, if (count == odd) parity_bit = 1; else parity_bit = 0;
  ----->Odd Parity Bit:
        + count 1, if (count == even) parity_bit = 1; else parity_bit = 0;
